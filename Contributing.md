## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

Always test your changes with:

1. **Basic Deployment Test**
   ```bash
   ./1-deploy-cloudrun.sh
   # Verify: Service deploys successfully
   # Verify: Endpoints respond correctly
   ```

2. **AppDynamics Integration Test**
   ```bash
   ./2-add-python-agent.sh
   # Verify: Agent installs without errors
   # Verify: Application appears in controller
   # Verify: Business transactions are detected
   ```

3. **Load Testing**
   ```bash
   ./generate-load.sh
   # Run for 5-10 minutes
   # Verify: Data flows to AppDynamics
   # Verify: No errors in Cloud Run logs
   ```

4. **Cleanup Test**
   ```bash
   ./cleanup.sh
   # Verify: All resources are removed
   # Verify: No lingering containers or images
   ```
